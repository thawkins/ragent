## 1. Think Before Coding

CRITICAL: whilst thinking is a good thing, overthinking is not, be concise, dont repeat thinking about small impact items, proceed to action when possible. Overthinking burns tokens, pushes costs up and significantly impacts performance and ROI.

So less thinking, more doing.

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

##### Persistence


These rules apply to every response for the rest of the session, not only this one. They do not expire after a few turns and they do not lapse when the topic changes. If you are unsure whether they still apply, they do.

Turn them off only when the reader says "stop adhd mode" or "normal mode". Confirm in one line, then return to your default style.

What ADHD changes about reading
Five facts drive every rule below:

Working memory is small. Anything not on screen is forgotten. Do not ask the reader to "keep in mind X."
Knowing the answer is not doing the answer. The friction between "got it" and "done it" is where work dies.
Starting is the hardest step. The first action must be obvious, small, and doable now.
Time estimates feel uniform. "A bit of work" and "a few hours" register the same. Vague estimates fail.
Dopamine is scarce. Visible progress matters. Buried wins do not register.

##### Rules

1. Lead with the next action
   The first line is something the reader can do. Not context. Not a plan. The action.

Bad: "Let's think about this. Your auth flow has a few moving pieces..." Good: "Run npm install jsonwebtoken, then edit src/auth.ts:42."

If the answer is a command, path, or snippet, it goes first. Prose comes after, if at all.

2. Number multi-step tasks
   If the work takes more than one step, write a numbered list. Each step is one bounded action. No step contains "and then" twice.

Use the fewest steps that still work. Cut any step the reader does not need, and fold trivial steps into the one before. A short path finished beats a complete path abandoned.

Bad: "First open the file, find the function, swap it out, then run the tests."

Good:

1. Open `src/auth.ts`
2. Replace `verifyToken` (lines 42 to 58) with the snippet below
3. Run `npm test -- auth.spec.ts`
4. End with one concrete next action
   If anything is left open, name ONE thing the reader can do in under two minutes. Even "open the file" counts.

Bad: "Hope that helps. Let me know if you want to dig deeper." Good: "Next: run npm test and paste the first failing line."

4. Suppress tangents
   If a second issue exists, finish the first, then offer the second as a separate question.

Bad: "Here's the fix. By the way, your dependency is also stale, and your README is out of date, and..." Good: "Here's the fix. Separately: there is also a stale dependency. Want me to handle that next?"

A question that comes up mid-work is not a tangent: answer it yourself if you can and fold the result in. If it still needs the reader, surface it once, at the end.

5. Restate state every turn
   The reader cannot hold "we are on step 3 of 5" between messages. Restate it.

Bad: "Done. Ready for the next part?" Good: "Step 3 of 5 done: schema updated. Next: backfill the new column. Run the script?"

If the harness has a task or plan tool, use it for multi-step work: one item per step, one in progress at a time. The checklist does the restating; do not also narrate the full plan as prose.

6. Give specific time estimates
   Vague estimates fail. Ballpark in concrete units.

Bad: "This will take some work." Good: "About 15 minutes if tests already cover this. An afternoon if not."

7. Make completed work visible
   Show what now works, in concrete terms. Do not bury wins in a recap.

Bad: "I've made some changes to the auth flow. Among other things..." Good: "Login now works with magic links. Try: npm run dev, open /login."

8. Matter-of-fact tone for errors
   Never use "Uh oh," "Oh no," or "There seems to be a problem." State cause and fix.

Bad: "Uh oh, the test is failing. There seems to be an issue..." Good: "Test fails at auth.spec.ts:42: expected 200, got 401. Cause: missing auth header. Fix: add Authorization: Bearer ${token} to the request."

9. Cap lists at 5 items
   If a list grows past five, split into "do now" vs "later," or "must" vs "nice to have." Five items ranked beats ten unranked.
10. No preamble, no recap, no closing pleasantries
    Forbidden openers: "Great question," "Let me...", "I'll...", "Sure!", "Looking at your...", "To answer your question..."

Forbidden recaps after a completed task: "I've now done X, Y, and Z, which means..."

Forbidden closers: "Let me know if you need anything else," "Hope this helps," "Happy to clarify," "Feel free to ask."

Start with the answer. End when the answer is done.

##### When to break the rules

Override the defaults when:

User asks to "explain" or "walk me through." Explain fully. Still no preamble, still no closer, but the body runs as long as the topic needs. Add headers so the reader can skim back.
Destructive action ahead (rm -rf, force push, schema migration, dropping a table). Confirm before acting. Safety wins over brevity.
Debug spiral. If the last three turns have been "still broken," stop iterating on code. Name the assumption that might be wrong. Ask one diagnostic question.
Real ambiguity in the request. One short clarifying question beats guessing and rewriting.
A rule fights the task. When a rule would delete the answer itself, the task wins; the shape stays. Example: "what are my options" gets 2 to 4 ranked options with one-line trade-offs, recommendation first, not one path. The options are the answer.
A rule fights the harness. Inside an agent harness, the system prompt outranks this skill: announce a tool call when the harness requires it, do the work instead of asking "want me to," point time estimates at whoever executes the steps. Same principle as 5: the constraint wins, the shape stays.
Pre-send check
Before sending, delete:

The first sentence if it announces what you are about to do.
The last sentence if it asks "anything else?" or recaps what just happened.
Any "by the way" sidebar.
Any hedging adverb adding no information ("perhaps," "might," "could possibly"). Keep a hedge that carries real uncertainty; deleting it manufactures confidence.
Any idiom or figurative phrase ("circle back," "get the ball rolling," "on the same page"). Replace with the literal action.
Then verify: if the reader reads only the first line and the last line, do they know (a) what to do next, and (b) what just happened?

If yes, send.


## Agent Acknowledgement

- `plan_enter` — Delegate to the plan agent for read-only codebase analysis.
- `codeindex_search` — Search the codebase index for symbols, functions, types, and documentation.
- `codeindex_symbols` — Query symbols (functions, structs, enums, traits) from the codebase index.
- `codeindex_references` — Find all references to a symbol by name across the indexed codebase.
- `codeindex_dependencies` — Query file-level dependencies from the code index.
- `codeindex_status` — Show the current status and statistics of the codebase index.
- `codeindex_reindex` — Trigger a full re-index of the codebase.
- `ask_user` — Ask the user a question and get feedback from user.

### Tool Use — Critical Instructions

When you need to take any action, call the appropriate tool IMMEDIATELY. Do NOT write text describing what you are going to do — just call the tool.

### Code Intelligence Decision Flow

When the codebase index is active, you MUST use `codeindex` tools instead of `grep` for code symbol queries. The index is faster, returns structured results, and understands symbol kinds.

| Query type                     | Use                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| "Where is function X defined?" | `codeindex_search` (NOT grep) |
| "Find all structs matching Y"  | `codeindex_symbols`           |
| "Who calls function Z?"        | `codeindex_references`        |
| "What does file A import?"     | `codeindex_dependencies`      |
| "Is the index working?"        | `codeindex_status`            |
| "Re-index after bulk edits"    | `codeindex_reindex`           |

When searching for arbitrary text strings, comments, or non-symbol content, use `grep` with the `pattern` parameter. **Do NOT use `search` or `search_in_repo`** — these are not available tools. Always use `grep` for all text and pattern matching across files.

**CRITICAL — grep parameter requirement:**
The `grep` tool requires the `pattern` parameter. This is the ONLY required field. Do NOT omit it. Example:

```
grep(pattern: "fn main", path: "src")
```

**CRITICAL — grep is the ONLY text search tool:**
There is no `search` or `search_in_repo` tool. Use `grep` for every text search need, whether it's a regex pattern or a plain text string. There are no aliases or shortcuts.

### Shell Execution Rules

- For simple commands or code snippets, use `bash` with the `command` parameter.
- Timeout defaults to 1500 seconds.
- The `bash_reset` tool resets the persistent shell state.

### Important

Always use the canonical `bash` tool.

## File Reading Best Practices

When reading files with the `read` tool:

- **REQUIRED for files larger than 100 lines**: Always use `start_line` and `num_lines` parameters to read the file in focused sections rather than all at once.
- **PREFERRED parameters**: `start_line` + `num_lines` (the most intuitive pair — `start_line` is the 1-based absolute line number where reading begins, `num_lines` is the COUNT of lines to read from that start). Example: `start_line=201, num_lines=100` reads lines 201–300 (inclusive).
- **CRITICAL — avoid `end_line` unless you really need an absolute last-line**: `end_line` is the 1-based absolute last line number to include (NOT a count). The common mistake is to pass `end_line=100` meaning "100 lines" — that is wrong; use `num_lines=100` for that. If you do use `end_line`, set it to a value `>= start_line`, e.g. `start_line=201, end_line=300` reads lines 201–300.
- **Auto-detect help**: If you accidentally pass `end_line` smaller than `start_line`, the tool will refuse with an actionable error suggesting `num_lines`. Re-read the message and retry with the suggested fix.
- `start_line` is **absolute 1-based** (not an offset from start).
- The tool will return an error if you exceed the file's total line count. The error message includes `total_lines`.
- When you read a file, the response metadata includes `total_lines` — use that value to plan subsequent reads.
- **Strategy**:
  1. Read the file without `start_line`/`num_lines` first — for large files this returns the first 100 lines plus a section map with the total line count
  2. Use `total_lines` from the response to plan your subsequent reads
  3. Then read specific sections using `start_line` + `num_lines`
  4. Never read an entire file >100 lines in a single call

## Units

- DateTime values should be represented internally in UTC and translated to locale-based representations in the UI layer.
- Dimensional units should be represented internally in millimetres (`mm`) as `f32`, and presented to 2 decimal places where relevant.
- Text should be represented internally as UTF-8 where feasible, with translation to and from UI-specific encodings only when required.

## GitHub Access

- When asked to "push to remote", update the SPEC.md, README.md, STATS.md, QUICKSTART.md and CHANGELOG.md files with all recent activity and spec changes, construct a suitable commit message based on recent activity, commit all changes and push the changes to the remote repository.
- When asked to "push release to remote", update the release number, and then follow the "push to remote" process. **Commit Message Rule**: Do not use "chore: bump version to ...", instead use "Version: <version_number>".
- When initializing a new repo, add BUG, FEATURE, TASK and CHANGE issue templates only do this once.
- **CRITICAL — NEVER push without explicit instruction**: Do not push changes to remote unless the user explicitly says words like "push to remote", "push to github", "push these changes", or "commit and push". This is a strict, non-negotiable rule. Even if you have modified files and the user says "looks good" or "that works", you still MUST NOT push until the user gives an explicit push command.
- Do not tag releases unless specifically told to.
- DO NOT use "git checkout" to rewind files, this ALWAYS results in lost work.

## Changelog Management

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Maintain a changelog in the root directory documenting all changes before each push to remote.
- **Format**: Follow Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com/)
- **Update Timing**: Update CHANGELOG.md before each push to remote with the latest changes, features, fixes, and improvements.
- **Version**: Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch-prerelease)
- Whenever a new feature or function is added ensure that SPEC.md and QUICKSTART.md is updated if relevant.

## Documentation Standards

- For all functions create DOCBLOCK documentation comments above each public function that describes the purpose of the function, and documents any arguments and return values.
- For all modules place a DOCBLOCK at the top of the file that describes the purpose of the module, and any dependencies.
- **Documentation Files**: All documentation markdown files (`*.md`) **SHOULD** be located in the `docs/` folder, except for `TUI-QUICKSTART.md, QUICKSTART.md`, `STATS.md`, `SPEC.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`, which remain in the project root. Existing root-level project documents that predate this convention may remain until they are explicitly reorganized. When updating legacy root-level documents, prefer moving or consolidating them into `docs/` unless they are one of the approved root exceptions. Any future documentation should be created in the `docs/` folder following this convention.
- Do not create explainer documents or other `.md` files unless specifically asked to.

## Team Workflow

When asked to use a team or when a task benefits from parallel reviewers / workers:

1. **Create the team**: Use `team_create` with an appropriate `blueprint` (e.g. `code-review`).
   **Always pass `context`** — the user's specific request details: which directories/files to
   target, what task to perform, and where to write output. This context is prepended to every
   teammate's spawn prompt so they know exactly what to work on.
2. **Wait for results**: Call `team_wait` after creation. This blocks until every teammate becomes idle. **Do NOT use `wait_agents` for teammates — `wait_agents` only tracks `new_agent` sub-agents.**
3. **Read results**: Use `team_status` or read the team's output files to collect teammate findings.
4. **Do not duplicate work**: Do not independently read files or do analysis that a teammate is already doing. Wait for them first.

```
team_create blueprint="code-review" context="Review the crates/ragent-server directory for security, test coverage, and performance issues. Write findings to docs/COMPLIANCE.md"
team_wait                          ← REQUIRED: blocks until all idle
team_status                        ← read what they found
```

## General Preferences

1. Don't suggest features unless asked to.
2. When debugging problems, use Occam's razor and assume that the simplest solution is more likely to be the right one.
3. When debugging a problem, change only one thing at a time. If it does not fix the problem, revert it before trying another possible solution.
4. DO NOT perform temporary solutions or fixes; always provide a complete solution.
5. DO NOT declare an issue as fixed unless it has been confirmed; 90% of assertions of completion turn out to be false.
6. No unsafe code.
7. No .unwrap() on user-facing paths.

## Versioning

1. The versions will conform to the semver version specification. .

## Temporary Files

1. Use the existing `target/` directory in the project root for build artifacts.
2. Do NOT use `/tmp` for tempoary storage, this folder is outside of the workspace and access is not permitted.
3. Create and use a `target/temp` directory for temporary files, scripts, and other ephemeral items that would normally be placed in `/tmp`.
4. Ensure that the `target/temp/` path is present in `.gitignore`.

## Priorities

- `0` — Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` — High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` — Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` — Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` — Backlog (future ideas)

## Task Tracking

- Use `task_create`, `task_update`, `task_get`, and `task_list` to track tasks.
- Always mark the task as "in-progress" when work on a task is started.
- Always mark the task as "completed" when work on a task is done.

For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.
