# Building Reliable Agentic AI Systems

A Case Study in building production-ready agentic AI systems

This paper presents the Preclinical Information Center (PRINCE), a cloud-hosted platform developed by Bayer AG with
Thoughtworks to address pharmaceutical industry challenges in drug development. PRINCE leverages Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Text-to-SQL to integrate decades of safety study reports. We describe PRINCE's
evolution from keyword-based search to an intelligent research assistant capable of answering complex questions and
drafting regulatory documents. We reflect on key engineering decisions through the lens of context engineering—how
information was shaped and routed between specialized agents—and harness engineering—how orchestration, recovery, and
observability were built around the models to maintain control and reliability. The system prioritizes trust through
transparency, explainability, and human-in-the-loop integration. PRINCE demonstrates AI's transformative potential in
pharmaceuticals, significantly improving data accessibility and research efficiency while ensuring governance and

Preclinical drug discovery is inherently complex and data-intensive. Researchers face the significant challenge of
efficiently accessing and analyzing vast volumes of information generated during this critical phase. Traditional
keyword-based search methods, often reliant on rigid Boolean logic, frequently fall short when confronted with the
nuanced and intricate nature of preclinical research questions.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has presented a transformative opportunity. By combining the generative power
of LLMs with the precision of information retrieval systems, [Retrieval-Augmented Generation][71] (RAG) has emerged as a
promising technique. This approach holds the potential to revolutionize preclinical data access, enabling researchers to
pose complex questions in natural language and receive accurate, context-rich answers grounded in proprietary data.

Recognizing this potential early, Bayer committed to exploring how these technologies could address longstanding
challenges in preclinical research.

In this post, we share that journey—how Bayer's early investment in generative AI has resulted in PRINCE, an agentic AI
system built on Agentic RAG. This case study explores the technical architecture, engineering decisions, and lessons
learned in transforming preclinical data retrieval from a challenging maze into an intuitive conversational experience.

Many of the engineering decisions behind PRINCE can now be understood through the lens of context engineering and
harness engineering, although when the system was first designed we did not use these terms. Context engineering shaped
what information each model received, what it did not receive, and how context moved between specialized steps such as
research, reflection, and writing. Harness engineering shaped the scaffolding around the models: orchestration, tool
boundaries, state persistence, retries, fallbacks, validation, reflection loops, observability, and human review.

While this post focuses on the technical architecture and engineering challenges, our paper published in [Frontiers in
Artificial Intelligence][72] covers the product evolution and business impact in more detail.

## The Challenge: Navigating the Preclinical Data Maze

The preclinical research landscape at Bayer, like many large pharmaceutical organizations, is characterized by a diverse
and extensive array of data. This includes highly structured datasets from various studies, alongside vast amounts of
unstructured information embedded within text documents such as study reports, publications, and regulatory submissions.
Researchers frequently encountered significant hurdles in accessing and analyzing this information effectively:
* Data Silos: information was fragmented and scattered across numerous disparate systems and repositories, making it
  exceedingly difficult to gain a comprehensive, holistic view of preclinical data related to a specific compound or
  study.
* Limited Search Capabilities: traditional keyword-based search engines struggled with the complexity and variability of
  preclinical terminology and research questions, often yielding irrelevant, incomplete, or overwhelming results.
* Time-Consuming Manual Analysis: extracting specific insights or compiling information across multiple documents
  required considerable manual effort, diverting valuable researcher time away from core scientific activities.

These inherent challenges highlighted a clear need for a more efficient, intelligent, and integrated approach to
preclinical data retrieval and analysis.

## The Solution: PRINCE - An Evolutionary Platform

To address these challenges, Bayer developed the Preclinical Information Center (PRINCE) platform. PRINCE was conceived
as a unified gateway to preclinical data, initially focusing on consolidating previously siloed structured study
metadata and exposing them in a “Searchable” manner. This initial phase allowed users to apply advanced filters and
retrieve information primarily from structured study metadata.

However, a significant portion of Bayer's valuable preclinical knowledge resides within unstructured PDF study reports
accumulated over decades. Due to numerous system migrations over the years, the structured metadata associated with
these reports could be incomplete, missing, or even contain incorrect annotations. Crucially, the authoritative “gold
standard” information was consistently present within the approved PDF study reports.

The emergence of Generative AI, particularly RAG, provided the key to unlocking this wealth of unstructured data. By
integrating RAG capabilities, PRINCE began to shift the paradigm from a filter-based 'search' tool to a natural language
'ask' system, enabling researchers to query the content of these study reports directly.

This evolution reflects PRINCE's progression through three distinct phases:
1. Search: the initial phase focused on creating a unified gateway to thousands of nonclinical study reports,
   consolidating multiple in-house data silos from various preclinical domains into a searchable format, primarily
   leveraging structured metadata.
2. Ask: this phase introduced an AI-powered question-answering system utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
   This enabled researchers to derive insights directly from unstructured data, including scanned PDFs from historical
   reports, by posing questions in natural language.
3. Do: the current phase positions PRINCE as an active research assistant capable of executing complex tasks. This is
   achieved through the integration of multi-agent systems, allowing the platform to handle intricate queries,
   orchestrate workflows, and support activities like drafting regulatory documents.

This deliberate evolution from Search to Ask to Do represents a strategic response to the industry's need for greater
efficiency and innovation in preclinical development. By providing researchers with increasingly powerful tools to
access, analyze, and act upon preclinical data, PRINCE aims to enable faster data-driven decision-making, reduce the
need for unnecessary experiments, and ultimately accelerate the development of safer, more effective therapies.

## System Architecture: Engineering a Reliable Agentic RAG System

The system functions as an interactive conversational UI, powered by a robust backend infrastructure. Its architecture,
designed for handling complex queries and delivering accurate, context-rich answers, is orchestrated using LangGraph and
served via a FastAPI application.

[Figure 1][73] provides the system context—UI, backend, data stores, LLM fallbacks, and observability—while [Figure
2][74] zooms into how the system coordinates its specialized agents.

Figure 1: System context and supporting platforms.
* User Request: the process begins when a user submits a request through the Conversational UI which is built with
  React.
* Orchestration: the user's request is routed to a LangGraph-based orchestration layer in the backend. This workflow
  engine coordinates a multi-stage process that progresses through clarifying user intent, thinking and planning,
  conducting research (using RAG and Text-to-SQL), validating data completion, and finally generating a response through
  the Writer agent. The workflow includes deliberate pause points and feedback loops to ensure data completeness before
  proceeding. (We explore the details of this agentic workflow in a dedicated section later.)
* Data Retrieval and State Management: the Researcher agents interact with a comprehensive and distributed data
  ecosystem:
* * Vector representations of all study reports are stored in OpenSearch, forming the core knowledge base for
    information retrieval.
  * Curated structured data, resulting from various ETL and harmonization processes, is accessed via Athena.
  * The state of the agent's execution is meticulously tracked. After each logical step (a LangGraph node execution),
    the corresponding state is persisted in PostgreSQL using a LangGraph checkpointer.
  * Broader application-level state is managed in DynamoDB.
* The system leverages internal GenAI platforms that host models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open-source
  providers. These platforms expose all models via a unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint, making it easy to swap models
  and choose the best tool for each task. They also manage the control plane, enforcing rate limits and other safeguards
  to prevent abuse.
* Resilience and Error Handling: robustness is a critical design principle, with multiple fallback mechanisms in place:
* * If a specific LLM fails, the system automatically retries the request several times before falling back to an
    alternative model or platform to ensure service continuity.
  * To recover quickly from transient failures, retries are implemented at both the individual LLM call level and the
    logical node level (i.e., an entire step in the agent's plan).
  * Also, agents are provided the context of the errors so that they can chart a different trajectory or alternative
    plan of action as a response.
* Observability and Evaluation: the entire system is monitored for performance and reliability:
* * General system health and metrics are tracked using Cloudwatch.
  * Langfuse serves as the primary observability tool, providing detailed traces of all production traffic. This allows
    for in-depth debugging of issues. Furthermore, evaluation datasets are stored and managed within Langfuse, making it
    easier to analyze performance scores and diagnose specific failures. The evaluation is done using RAGAS evaluation
    framework. The live traffic evaluation is done on a daily basis while the dataset evaluation is done whenever
    significant changes are made to the core workflow, prompts, or underlying models.
* Final Response: once the agents have processed the request and generated a satisfactory response, it is sent back to
  the Conversational UI to be presented to the user.

A design principle running through this architecture is context discipline. Larger context windows did not remove the
need to be selective about what each agent sees. In early iterations, putting too much information into the context made
the system harder to steer and harder to evaluate. PRINCE therefore avoids treating the prompt as one large container
for all available information. Instead, different stages receive different context: planning context for Think & Plan,
retrieval context for the Researcher Agent, evidence context for the Reflection Agent, and synthesis context for the
Writer Agent. This reduces context pollution and makes the system easier to debug, evaluate, and improve.

These steps ensure that the system can provide reliable and contextually relevant answers to a wide range of complex
queries by leveraging a sophisticated, multi-agent architecture and a diverse set of powerful tools and data sources.

## The Agentic RAG System

PRINCE incorporates an agentic [RAG][75] system ([Figure 2][76]) to handle complex user requests that require multiple
steps, reasoning, and interaction with different tools or data sources. This setup, implemented using LangGraph,
orchestrates the overall workflow and leverages Researcher Agent, Writer Agent, and Reflection Agent for specific tasks.
The system is designed to be robust and reliable, with multiple fallback mechanisms in place to ensure that the system
can continue to function even if some of the components fail.

Figure 2: The research workflow.

### Clarify User Intent

The Clarify User Intent step serves as the first line of defense against ambiguity. As the system scaled to include
diverse domains like toxicology and pharmacology, simple user queries often became ambiguous, making it difficult to
automatically select the right tools. Rather than relying on expensive trial-and-error across all data sources, the
system proactively asks clarifying questions to pinpoint the specific domain or data type.

This ensures the system enhances the query with the necessary constraints to target the correct tools. We are also
optimizing this by developing domain-level selection in the UI, which will allow users to pre-filter valid tools
upfront. To further reduce friction, the system also provides AI-assisted source recommendations: when a user has not
selected any data source — or has selected several without a clear focus — the model analyzes the intent behind the
user's query and suggests the most relevant sources. The user retains full control and can accept, adjust, or override
the recommendation, ensuring domain expertise always has the final say. This “fail-fast” mechanism prevents wasted
execution on vague queries, while careful tuning ensures the system remains unobtrusive when the intent is already
clear.

From a context engineering perspective, this step is the first assembly decision in the workflow: it constrains which
tools, domains, and data sources will be in scope before any retrieval begins, ensuring subsequent agents receive a
focused rather than open-ended problem.

### Think & Plan: Process Reflection

The Think & Plan step is responsible for devising a strategy to fulfill the user's request. This critical component
gives the system a dedicated space to reason about the next steps before taking action—a technique inspired by
[Anthropic's Think tool][77]. Importantly, this step performs process reflection: evaluating whether the agent is making
the right progress toward its end goal and is on right trajectory, rather than evaluating the data itself.

In multi-step agentic workflows, particularly those involving many sequential actions, process reflection is essential.
Consider a scenario where the system needs to execute 50 steps to complete a complex task. At each juncture, the system
must ask: Am I taking these steps in the right manner? Am I making the progress I'm supposed to make? Is the current
trajectory leading toward the user's goal? The Think & Plan step provides this metacognitive capability, allowing the
system to reflect on its own workflow and adjust its strategy accordingly.

This “thinking space” has proven particularly valuable in scenarios involving multiple tool calls. When PRINCE was
initially developed, it had only a couple of tools: one for RAG-based retrieval and another for Text-to-SQL queries.
However, as we integrated more data sources to expand the system's capabilities, the number of available tools grew
significantly. With this explosion of tools came an inherent challenge: overlapping concerns and domain boundaries
across different tools.

For example, multiple tools might serve similar but subtly different purposes—querying structured metadata versus
unstructured reports, or retrieving study summaries versus detailed experimental data. When presented with tools that
belong to similar domains but handle slightly different data, the LLM would sometimes struggle to select the most
appropriate tool for a given query. By introducing a dedicated thinking step, the system can explicitly reason about
which tool best matches the user's intent, evaluate the characteristics of each available tool, and make a more informed
decision. This approach led to a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of tool selection.

Beyond tool selection, the Think & Plan step is essential for orchestrating multi-step processes. Many complex queries
in PRINCE require a series of tool calls where the output of one tool must be analyzed before determining the next
action. For instance, the system might first query structured metadata to identify relevant studies, then use those
study IDs to retrieve detailed information from unstructured reports, and finally synthesize the findings. Without a
dedicated space for process reflection, the system would attempt to execute these steps linearly without evaluating
whether each step is bringing it closer to the goal. With the thinking step in place, the system can pause, assess its
progress in the workflow, and intelligently plan the subsequent tool calls needed to complete the user's request.

### The Researcher Agent

The Researcher Agent serves as the system's primary information gatherer. As we onboard new scientific domains onto
PRINCE, we consistently observe that data falls into two primary categories: structured and unstructured. While specific
implementation techniques may vary across domains — for instance, leveraging Snowflake Cortex Analyst for pharmacology
queries for Text-to-SQL versus other more custom methods for toxicology—the fundamentals behind these retrieval
strategies remain consistent.

As PRINCE expands across multiple preclinical domains, a single Researcher agent with a flat tool list becomes
increasingly hard to manage. Many tools operate on similar concepts—“studies”, “findings”, “assays”—but point to
different underlying datasets, schemas, and regulatory interpretations depending on the domain. For example, when a user
refers to “the study”, the relevant context might be a repeat‑dose toxicology study, a cardiovascular safety
pharmacology package, or a particular assay in aggregated mass‑data tables, each with its own preferred sources of
truth.

To avoid one monolithic agent juggling overlapping tools and subtly different data contracts, we are actively evolving
the Researcher capability into a hierarchy of domain‑specific sub‑agents. In this proposed architecture, each domain
agent will own its own toolset (for example, toxicology RAG + tox metadata SQL, or pharmacology RAG + assay‑level SQL)
along with tailored prompt instructions that encode how that domain’s data model works, which tables or indices are
authoritative, and how to interpret key concepts. We anticipate this will keep responsibilities coherent, reduce
accidental cross‑domain leakage, and make it easier to reason about and test retrieval behaviour per domain.

To effectively harvest insights from this diverse landscape, the Researcher Agent employs a [hybrid retriever][78]
approach focused on two distinct patterns:
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): for processing unstructured data, primarily PDF reports.
* Text-to-SQL: for querying structured data housed in Amazon Athena.

This dual-strategy allows the system to bridge the gap between narrative scientific reports and quantitative
experimental data.

In this updated vision, the top‑level Researcher Agent is designed to act as a coordinator rather than a single
all‑knowing component. Given the clarified user intent and any explicit domain selection from the UI, it will route the
query to the appropriate domain sub‑agent, which can then decide how to combine RAG and Text‑to‑SQL within its own
boundary. This pattern aims to preserve the simplicity of “one researcher” from the user’s perspective, while internally
allowing each domain to evolve its own tools, schemas, and retrieval recipes without destabilizing the rest of the
system.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Unstructured Data

Given the vast repository of thousands of preclinical study reports and other unstructured documents, RAG is essential
for extracting relevant insights by grounding LLM responses in this specific knowledge base. The RAG pipeline comprises
a comprehensive ingestion process and a sophisticated query-time architecture.

**Ingestion Process:** Preclinical study reports, mostly PDFs spanning decades and often including scanned documents
with complex tables, are first centralized into an S3 data lake and passed through an extraction pipeline tuned for this
corpus. The extracted text is normalized into structured JSON and then chunked using a strategy that preserves enough
scientific context while keeping chunks efficient for retrieval.

Each chunk is enriched with study‑ and section‑level metadata from Amazon Athena (for example study ID, compound,
species, route, page, and parent section), which later enables precise metadata filtering in the RAG layer. Finally,
these annotated chunks are embedded and indexed in [Amazon OpenSearch Service][79], forming the vector store that backs
semantic and metadata‑aware retrieval over both the historical corpus and the daily deltas as new or updated reports
arrive.

**Query-Time RAG Pipeline:** When a user submits a query, the system initiates a multi-stage retrieval process. This
pipeline is engineered to effectively retrieve the most relevant and trustworthy information from the vector database to
ground the LLM's response.

To illustrate this pipeline, consider the example query: “Were any of the following clinical findings observed in study
T123456-2: piloerection, ataxia, eyes partially closed, and loose faeces?”. The system processes this query through the
following steps:
* Keyword Extraction: the user's natural language query is first analyzed by an LLM. Through careful prompt engineering,
  the model is instructed to extract keywords highly relevant for keyword search within our document corpus (e.g.,
  “piloerection”, “ataxia”, “eyes partially closed”, “loose faeces”).
* Metadata Filter Generation: concurrently, the LLM generates a metadata filter based on the query. For example, a
  filter eq(study_id, T123456-2) is extracted to narrow the search space. This filter is dynamically generated using
  few-shot prompting with various permutation and combination examples provided to the model, ensuring it can handle
  diverse filtering requests.
* Query Expansion: to ensure comprehensive retrieval and account for variations in phrasing and terminology, [query
  expansion][80] (multi query or query rewrite) is performed by a smaller, faster model. This generates n=5 semantically
  similar queries based on the original question. For the example query, this might include variations like:
* * “Clinical symptoms reported in research T123456-2, including goosebumps, lack of coordination, semi-closed eyelids,
    or diarrhea.”
  * “Recorded observations in experiment T123456-2 regarding hair standing on end, unsteady movement, eyes not fully
    open, or watery stools.”
  * “What were the clinical observations noted in trial T123456-2, particularly regarding the presence of hair
    bristling, impaired balance, partially shut eyes, or soft bowel movements.”
* Hybrid Retriever: information retrieval from the vector database ([Amazon OpenSearch Service][81]) utilizes a Hybrid
  Search approach that combines metadata filtering, semantic vector similarity search (kNN), and keyword-based
  retrieval. This process is executed as follows:
* * Metadata Filtering: the metadata filter generated in the previous step (e.g., eq(study_id, T123456-2)) is applied
    directly to the vector database query. This pre-filters the search space based on the structured metadata attached
    to the chunks during the ingestion process from Amazon Athena, ensuring that only chunks associated with the
    specified study ID (or other relevant metadata) are considered. This significantly reduces the search space from
    millions of vectors to a more manageable range of tens to hundreds, improving efficiency and relevance.
  * Parallel Hybrid Search Execution: for each of the n=5 expanded queries, a single hybrid search query is executed in
    parallel against the filtered Amazon OpenSearch Service vector database. This query combines both semantic vector
    similarity search (kNN) and keyword-based search, leveraging OpenSearch's capabilities for efficient multi-vector
    and text search.
  * Weighted Result Scoring: within each individual hybrid search executed in parallel, a weighted approach is applied
    to the results. A weight of 0.7 is given to the semantic search results and 0.3 to the keyword search results to
    balance contextual understanding and precise term matching. This weighting was determined through experimentation to
    optimize retrieval effectiveness for our data.
  * Result Aggregation and Initial Ranking: the results (sets of relevant chunks with their weighted scores) from all 5
    parallel hybrid search executions are aggregated. Unique chunks from all search results are pulled together, and
    their highest weighted score across the parallel searches is used to determine an initial ranking. This step
    initially retrieves a larger set of potential context chunks (k=~20) based on these aggregated and weighted scores.
* Reranking: the initial set of retrieved chunks (k=~20) is then refined using a [Rerank][82] step. A cross-encoder
  model (bge-reranker-large) evaluates the relevance of each retrieved chunk against the original question, selecting
  the top k=7 most relevant chunks to be used as context for the LLM. This reranking step is crucial for ensuring that
  the most pertinent information, even if not the highest in initial semantic similarity or keyword match, is
  prioritized for the final response generation.
* Final LLM Prompt Generation: the refined context (k=7 chunks) is then combined with the original question to form the
  final LLM prompt. This prompt is carefully constructed to guide the LLM in generating a focused and accurate response
  based on the provided context, minimizing the risk of hallucination.
* Response Generation with Citation: a state-of-the-art reasoning model then processes the final prompt and the provided
  context to generate response with citation. The LLM synthesizes the information from the context to formulate a
  coherent and accurate answer. Crucially, the response automatically includes citations linking back to the specific
  chunks in the original document(s) that support the generated answer.
* Monitoring: the entire Query-Time RAG process, from initial query to final response generation, is continuously
  monitored using Langfuse for observability, performance and quality analysis.

#### Text-to-SQL for Structured Data

While RAG excels at unstructured data, queries requiring precise filtering, aggregation, or comparison of structured
data points are better suited for Text-to-SQL. Examples include “Give me 50 example studies done on RAT” or retrieving
specific numerical assay results including dosage groups. As shown in the Researcher Agent can intelligently decide to
hand over such queries to the Text-to-SQL tool.

Figure 3: Text-to-SQL tool

The process for converting a natural language question into an executable SQL query and retrieving results involves
several key steps:
* Query Analysis and Intent Recognition: the user's natural language query is analyzed to understand the user's intent
  and identify the specific data points and filters being requested from the structured metadata.
* Schema Understanding and Relevant Schema Selection: to accurately generate a SQL query, the LLM requires an
  understanding of the relevant database schema. For large and complex schemas, only the necessary schema components
  relevant to the user's query are dynamically injected into the LLM's context. This reduces the complexity for the
  model and improves the accuracy of the generated SQL.
* Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting for SQL Generation: converting complex natural language queries into precise SQL dialect
  (in our case, Athena) can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we employ dynamic few-shot prompting. A collection
  of carefully hand-picked examples, representing various complex query patterns and their corresponding correct SQL
  translations in the Athena dialect, is stored in a separate collection within our vector database. Based on the user's
  query, relevant examples are retrieved from this “semantic layer” using vector similarity search and included in the
  prompt to the LLM. This provides the LLM with in-context learning examples, guiding it to generate accurate SQL
  queries in the correct dialect. Continuous addition of new examples based on encountered challenges further improves
  the system's performance over time.
* SQL Query Generation and Validation: a model with strong code generation capabilities, conditioned on the relevant
  schema information and dynamic few-shot examples, generates the corresponding SQL query. To ensure the LLM can
  accurately process the results and identify the correct rows for subsequent synthesis, certain essential columns, such
  as study ID and study title, are always included in the generated SELECT query. The generated query is then validated
  to ensure it adheres to allowed operations (e.g., only SELECT queries are permitted; DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE queries
  are explicitly blocked for data integrity and security). Notably, an earlier iteration of this process included an LLM
  review step for generated SQL queries; however, this step was later removed as it was found that the reviewing LLM
  sometimes incorrectly flagged valid queries as erroneous, hindering efficiency without a commensurate gain in
  accuracy.
* Query Execution and Result Limiting: the validated SQL query is executed against the structured metadata database in
  Amazon Athena. To prevent data flooding and manage response size, the system enforces a limit, fetching not more than
  50 records at a time.
* Error Handling and Iteration: if the SQL query execution is successful, the retrieved results (up to the specified
  limit) are returned and integrated into the overall response generation process. If the query fails due to syntax
  errors, schema issues, or other execution errors, the error message from the database, along with the generated query
  and the original context, is passed back to the same model. The LLM analyzes the error and the context to generate a
  corrected SQL query. This iterative process of generating and executing SQL queries is attempted up to 3 times before
  the tool gives up and reports a failure, potentially indicating an unresolvable query or a limitation in the model's
  ability to handle the specific request.

### The Reflection Agent: Data Validation and Sufficiency

While the Think & Plan step provides process reflection, the Reflection Agent performs a complementary but distinct type
of reflection: data reflection. This crucial component evaluates whether the data retrieved from various tools is
sufficient and relevant to answer the user's question—a fundamentally different concern from whether the workflow itself
is progressing correctly.

In multi-step agentic workflows, these two types of reflection serve different but equally important purposes. Process
reflection (Think & Plan) ensures the agent is taking the right steps and making appropriate progress toward the goal.
Data reflection (Reflection Agent) ensures that the information gathered through those steps is adequate to fulfill the
user's request. Both are essential: an agent might execute a perfectly valid workflow (good process) but still retrieve
insufficient data to answer the question, or conversely, might have access to sufficient data but fail to progress
effectively through the workflow.

As illustrated in the research workflow diagram ([Figure 2][83]), after initial information retrieval and 'think & plan'
loops, the Reflection Agent is invoked when Think & Plan step thinks that the process has progressed well enough and is
ready to evaluate the data. 'Reflection Agent' evaluates the sufficiency and relevance of the collected data by
comparing the retrieved context against the user's original query and identifying potential gaps or missing information.
If the gathered information is deemed insufficient to provide a complete response, the Reflection Agent generates
specific follow-up questions designed to acquire the necessary missing information. These follow-up questions are then
handed back to the Think & Plan step, which initiates further retrieval steps to obtain more comprehensive results. This
iterative process of data validation and subsequent information retrieval, driven by the Reflection Agent's generated
questions, demonstrates the system's ability to refine its search strategy based on the initial results. If the
information is sufficient, the workflow proceeds to the next step.

### The Writer Agent: Answer Synthesis and Formatting

Once the Researcher Agent has collected the relevant evidence from RAG and Text-to-SQL, the Writer Agent is responsible
for turning that raw material into the final answer shown to the user. Its job is not to “discover” new information, but
to synthesize the retrieved context, respect user instructions, and enforce PRINCE's quality constraints during
generation.

The Writer Agent operates with a few non-negotiable rules. It must ground every claim in the supplied context and attach
accurate citations back to the underlying chunks and study IDs, since verifiability is critical in a regulated
environment. It is also responsible for honoring user-level formatting requirements (for example, tables, bullet points,
or specific section structures) and for aligning with domain-specific answer standards used by the preclinical
scientists.

For more complex responses—such as multi-section summaries or partially filled regulatory templates—the architecture
supports extending the Writer Agent with a short internal review loop. In this pattern, the Writer would first draft an
answer, then a reviewing step would check for missing sections, inconsistent tables, or gaps relative to the original
question, and may send targeted instructions back to the Writer to revise specific parts. This design enables a
lightweight form of reflection focused on answer completeness and presentation, complementing the Reflection Agent's
focus on data sufficiency earlier in the workflow. Importantly, all outputs from these regulatory drafting workflows are
intended for expert review; final submissions are authored and approved by qualified personnel.

This gives PRINCE three complementary reflection loops. Process reflection checks whether the workflow is on the right
path and helps catch bad trajectory, wrong tool choice, or poor sequencing. Data reflection checks whether the gathered
evidence is sufficient and helps catch thin evidence, missing context, or gaps in coverage. Draft reflection checks
whether the generated output is complete and helps catch missing sections, incomplete tables, or synthesis gaps.

Together, these agents form a practical context engineering pattern. The system does not simply keep adding more
information to the prompt. It routes the right context to the right capability at the right time: planning context for
Think & Plan, retrieval context for the Researcher, evidence context for the Reflection Agent, and synthesis context for
the Writer. This plays out in concrete decisions throughout the system: the Text-to-SQL step injects only the schema
components relevant to the current query rather than the full database schema; the Reflection Agent receives the
original question alongside collected evidence to assess gaps, not the full workflow history; and the Writer Agent
receives curated chunks with citation constraints, not raw retrieval output. Moving from a monolithic agent to this
structured workflow meant each agent could be evaluated, debugged, and improved in isolation.

## Building Trust in a Production LLM System

Building and maintaining user trust is paramount for the successful adoption of any AI system, particularly in a
critical environment like preclinical drug discovery where decisions have significant implications. For a production LLM
application, trust is not just about accuracy; it's also about reliability, transparency, and the ability for users to
verify the information provided. Several mechanisms are integrated into PRINCE to achieve this:

### Transparency and Explainability

Ensuring transparency and explainability is a critical aspect of PRINCE's design, fostering user trust and enabling
verification of the generated responses. The system incorporates several mechanisms to achieve this:
* Intermediate Steps and Transparency: given the iterative nature of the workflow and the potential time required to
  generate a final answer, maintaining transparency is crucial. The intermediate steps executed by the system during
  query processing, information retrieval, and reflection, including the queries formulated and the tools utilized, are
  displayed to the user. This provides visibility into the system's reasoning process and allows users to follow the
  steps taken to arrive at the final answer. Additionally, when relevant context (chunks) is identified, links to these
  source materials are presented on the screen, allowing users to see precisely which information was shortlisted and
  used to formulate the final response.
* Factuality Verification through Citation: the system facilitates user verification of factuality through a robust
  citation mechanism. The generated answer is consistently accompanied by citations referencing the original source
  documents and structured metadata. These citations are directly linked to the context displayed to the user, enabling
  them to easily verify the accuracy of the claims made in the response and trace the information back to its origin.
  Users can hover over any sentence in the generated response to see the corresponding citation, which provides a link
  to the PRINCE and to the source document, including the page number and the exact quote from the report used to
  support that part of the answer. This granular level of citation significantly enhances the credibility and
  trustworthiness of the system's output and simplifies the human review process.

### Evaluation

Rigorous evaluation is fundamental to building and maintaining a reliable LLM application. PRINCE's performance and
reliability are assessed through a combination of two types of evaluations: Dataset Evaluations and Live Traffic
Evaluations.
* Dataset Evaluations: conducted whenever significant changes are made to the core workflow, prompts, or underlying
  models, these evaluations utilize curated datasets with pre-defined reference answers, meticulously prepared by
  subject matter experts and stored in Langfuse. A custom evaluation script processes each question and compares the
  generated response against the reference answer, yielding quantitative metrics such as Faithfulness (degree to which
  the answer is supported by context), Answer Relevancy (how well the answer addresses the query), Context Relevancy
  (relevance of retrieved chunks), Answer Accuracy (comparison to ground truth), and Semantic Similarity with Reference
  (semantic similarity to reference answer). Given the agentic nature of the system, applying appropriate evaluation
  metrics at different workflow stages, analogous to a testing pyramid, is crucial in addition to evaluating overall
  end-to-end performance.
* Live Traffic Evaluations: performed daily as a batch job on real user queries from the live environment (without
  pre-defined reference answers), these evaluations provide valuable insights into real-world performance. Metrics such
  as Faithfulness and Answer Relevancy can still be assessed. Live traffic evaluations are essential for monitoring
  system behavior, identifying potential issues like hallucinations in production, and understanding performance on
  diverse live queries.

### Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of the system's performance and outputs is essential for proactive identification and resolution
of issues in a production environment. Using platforms like Langfuse, we continuously monitor PRINCE to identify
potential biases, errors, or areas for improvement, ensuring the reliability and safety of the system's responses.

## Engineering for Resilience: Error Handling and Recovery

Given the complexity of the multi-step workflow inherent in PRINCE, robust error handling and recovery mechanisms are
critical to ensure the system's reliability and provide a seamless user experience. The system is engineered to recover
gracefully from failures at various stages without requiring a complete restart of the entire workflow.

Key aspects of our error handling and recovery approach include:
* State Persistence: the state of the entire workflow graph is persistently stored, enabling the system to resume
  execution directly from the failed node. This is achieved by storing the Agent State, representing the progress of the
  agents through the workflow, in Postgres. Other aspects of the application state, such as logs, intermediate steps,
  and citations, are stored in DynamoDB. This separation and persistence of state are crucial for achieving robustness
  in a stateful agentic system.
* Built-in Retries: the system is configured with built-in retries at various steps in the workflow. If a particular
  step encounters a transient failure, the system will automatically attempt to re-execute it a predefined number of
  times before signaling a more permanent error.
* User-Initiated Retries: in addition to automated retries, users have the option to manually retry a failed query
  through the interface. When a user initiates a retry, the system leverages the persisted state to continue the
  workflow directly from the point of failure, intelligently skipping the steps that were successfully completed in the
  previous attempt. This significantly improves user experience and saves computational resources.
* Framework-Level Support: the error recovery mechanisms are significantly supported by the underlying framework,
  LangGraph, which offers solid built-in capabilities for managing workflow state and handling errors within the graph
  structure. This provides a robust foundation for building resilient agentic workflows.
* LLM Fallbacks: to enhance reliability and mitigate issues related to model availability or performance, the system
  incorporates custom LLM fallback handling. If a call to a primary LLM provider or a specific model fails after a few
  retries, the system automatically falls back to an alternative LLM from a different provider. This mechanism is
  crucial for maintaining system availability and responsiveness, especially as platform downtimes for external services
  are outside of our direct control.

This comprehensive approach to error handling and recovery minimizes the impact of transient failures, reduces the need
for users to restart complex queries from scratch, and contributes to cost and latency savings by avoiding redundant
execution of successful steps and LLM calls, all of which are essential for a production-ready system.

These mechanisms are harness engineering in practice. The LangGraph workflow acts as the control layer around the
agents: it defines which component can act, which tools it can use, where the workflow can pause, how failures are
retried, how state is persisted, and when the system should move from research to reflection to writing. This harness
makes the system less opaque and more reliable than an unconstrained autonomous agent. It gives the application clear
control points for recovery, inspection, evaluation, and human intervention.

## Enhancing Data Quality: Named Entity Recognition and Annotation

The accuracy and completeness of the structured metadata in Amazon Athena are critical for the performance of the
Text-to-SQL component and overall data discoverability within PRINCE. Due to historical data migrations and varied
annotation practices across different laboratories and systems over Bayer's extensive operational history, the metadata
can sometimes be incomplete, missing, or incorrect.

To address this challenge and continuously enhance the quality of the structured metadata, we have developed a utility
system that employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract and create accurate annotations directly from the study
PDFs. This system is designed to read the textual content of the preclinical reports and identify key entities and
associated information that should be represented in the structured metadata.

The process involves:
* Processing study PDFs to extract text and identify relevant entities (e.g., study IDs, compound names, species, routes
  of administration, dosage information, clinical findings, etc.).
* Generating structured annotations based on the identified entities and their relationships within the text.

We are actively working on integrating this utility system into our data pipelines to automatically correct and enrich
the data within the Amazon Athena database. The system's performance in generating accurate annotations has been
evaluated against curated datasets, demonstrating promising results. To manage the integration of these annotations into
the production database, we are developing an evaluation system that provides a confidence score for each extracted
field. Fields with a high confidence score will be automatically used to update the corresponding entries in Amazon
Athena. Fields with lower confidence scores will be quarantined and flagged for human review and intervention, ensuring
data accuracy while leveraging automation. This approach aims to continuously improve the quality of the structured
metadata, making it a more reliable source of information for PRINCE and other downstream applications.

## The Journey Continues: Iterative Development

PRINCE has been available to end-users since early 2024, with the agentic integration introduced later that year. This
has been crucial for gathering real-world feedback and driving iterative development. A key principle guiding our
development has been the understanding that building a production-ready LLM application is an iterative process; we
don't wait for features to be absolutely perfect before seeking user feedback. Instead, we prioritize delivering value
early and continuously refining the system based on real-world usage.

In the initial stages, our focus was squarely on achieving the desired accuracy and performance for core
